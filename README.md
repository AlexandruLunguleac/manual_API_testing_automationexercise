This repository contains my final project for the Programmer's Assistant accreditation. 

The final project is testing an API (Application Programming Interface) via the Postman application.

Site used for testing: https://www.automationexercise.com/#google_vignette

Performed tests:

1. GET All Products - HTTP Response code 200 OK, which means that request was done successfully, returning the product list.
This request it is composed from request method, which defines the type of action that we wish to take it, in this case being GET, the request URL, which is like the endpoint address which we wish to interact with it, in this case being https://automationexercise.com/api/productsList, headers which offers additional information about the request, like common headers, which includes things like Content-Type, which specifies the data format that was sent and Authorization, which it can contain authentification details, request body where we include the data which we want to send to the server, in this case the list of all products, and the query parameters which contain additional information that we put on the URL. In the response body we see that we got the list of all products as result. Also I made the following JavaScript tests:
   -Response status code is 200
   -Response time is less than 1000ms
   -Validate the structure of the products array
